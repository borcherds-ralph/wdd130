            <p>I am you instructor for this course. My last name is pronounced like orchards with a B in front of it.
            </p>
            <p>I am a graduate of Brigham Young University-Idaho with a Bachelors in Web Design and Development. After
                graduation I decided to become an instructor for the school and give back to the school. I found that I
                enjoyed
                teaching while I was a student.</p>
            <p>I live in the deserts of Southern California about 20 miles outside of Palm Springs, CA. I am an IT
                Consultant
                and do a lot of web consulting for local companies. I am always working on a new web project using PHP,
                JavaScript, CSS/SCSS, MySQL technologies. You will learn about these as you learn more about web
                development. A
                couple of local companies do use Logos that I created while a student in two of the classes I took,
                COMM-130,
                ART-230.</p>
            <p>My wife and daughter also received their Bachelors from BYU-Idaho. My wife earned her Bachelors of
                Science in
                Nursing and my daughter earned her Business Administration Bachelors. We all graduated the same
                semester.
            </p>
            <p>I am the First Counselor in the Bishopric in my ward and spend a lot of time with the youth as a result
                of
                that
                calling. We have seven grandchildren with number eight due in August.</p>
