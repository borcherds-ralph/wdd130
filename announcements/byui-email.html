    <p> This will log you into your BYU-Idaho email which is on the Microsoft
      365 Servers. This is an outlook e-mail. You can forward all these e-mails
      to your personal e-mail. </p>
    <p> BYU-Idaho uses this e-mail for communications to you from the school.
      You will get at least 2 e-mails every week into this e-mail account. YOu
      must get into the habit of checking it at least twice a week. </p>
    <p> For those of you the do not like email. This is the most common form of
      communication and you must get used to look at it as you will be using
      this in business. I have 9 email accounts that I have to check weekly. I
      have that many as I have a few clients that require me to have an email
      account on their system for security reasons. </p>
