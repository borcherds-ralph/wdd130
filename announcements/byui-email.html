    <h1>How to access BYU-Idaho e-mail</h1>

    <h2>as a BYU Pathway Worldwide or PathwayConnect student</h2>

    <p>Login into the Pathway Worldwide portal</p>

    <p> Look at the top menu bar in the center and change it to say BYU-Idaho.
      The default is PathwayConnect </p>

    <p> Then click on your name in the top right corner and then select Go To
      Email. You BYU-Idaho e-mail is to the left of this link. </p>

    <p> This will log you into your BYU-Idaho email which is on the Microsoft
      365 Servers. This is an outlook e-mail. I do not recommend forwarding all
      these e-mails to your personal account.</p>

    <p>The reason for not forwarding these e-mails is because you loose who sent
      the e-mail and you cannot reply to it. The forwarded e-mail will come from
      your e-mail address at the school. You can setup Outlook on your smart
      device.</p>

    <p> BYU-Idaho uses this e-mail for communications to you from the school.
      You will get at least 2 e-mails every week into this e-mail account. You
      must get into the habit of checking it at least twice a week. </p>

    <p>For those of you the do not like email. This is the most common form of
      communication and you must get used to looking at it as you will be using
      this in business. I personally have multiple email accounts that I have to
      check. I have a few because some clients require me to have an email
      account on their system for security reasons. </p>
