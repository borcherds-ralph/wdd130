    <h2>VSCode Project Manager Extension</h2>
    <p class="western">It is recommended that if you are doing multiple coding projects at a time and each has its own
        folder/directory structure, you install an extension called Project Manager</p>
    <p>Go to extensions</p>
    <p>Search for Project Manager</p>
    <p><img src="//borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/project-manager-search.png" alt="PM"></p>
    <p>Click Install Once installed open one project folder only</p>
    <p>Click on the Project Manager icon in the icons on the left or right of the editor</p>
    <p><img src="//borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/project-manager-icon.png" alt="PM Icon"></p>
    <p>You should see a blue button that states: Project<strong> Manager: Save Project -</strong> Click that button and
        you
        will be prompted for a name at the top center of the screen. The default name is the folder name.</p>

            alt="PM Save 1">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>That will then add that project name to the Project Manager list of projects.</p>
    <p>Open the second project folder in its own workspace.</p>
    <p>Click the Save icon in the Project Manager folder icon area.</p>

            alt="PM Save 2"><br><br></p>
    <p>Give your project a name and hit enter. This will add it to the list.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><strong>Advanced Topic</strong></h3>
    <p>If you click the edit icon, looks like a pencil, it will open the JSON file that lists your projects. The format
        is
        quite easy to follow. The rule is that each project must be enclosed with { } and must have a comma between the
        project section.</p>
