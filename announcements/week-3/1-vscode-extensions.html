  <p> I want to recommend an extension for all of you you that are or will be
    taking more development classes. </p>
  <p> This extension is called Project Manager. It will allow you to switch
    between your development projects without having to go to FILE - OPEN FOLDER
    every time. </p>
  <p> To install this extension click on the Extensions Icon on the left. It is
    this icon <img
      src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/extension-icon.png"
      alt="VSCode Extension Icon">
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> In the search bar at the top type in "Project Manager" and the extension
    should show in the top couple options. </p>
  <p>

      alt="Project Manager">
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> click on the listing and then select Install in the search results or on
    the page that is displayed. </p>
  <p>

      alt="install button"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR &nbsp; &nbsp; <img
      src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/search-install.png"
      alt="search install button">
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Once it is installed you will see a new icon in the Left Bar. <img
      src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/project-manager-icon.png"
      alt="Project Manager Icon">
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> When you click on it for the first time there will be a button that will
    let you save the current project as your first project. </p>
  <p> After you have saved the first one, to save more projects, you open the
    project and click the save icon at the top of the Project Manager list of
    projects. The red arrow is pointing to the save icon.&nbsp; This is a small
    list of my projects I have/currently work on. </p>
  <p>

      alt="Project Manager Save">
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> You can also add all your projects manually by editing a file called
    projects.json that is located in the settings folder for VSCode. Easy way to
    access that file is to click the pencil icon. If unsure how to format the
    file add a few using the icons and then look at the file. It is easy to edit
    if you pay attention to what is going on first. </p>
  <p> This is the basic setup. There are more advanced options you can learn on
    your own. </p>
  <p> Let me know if you have any other questions about this extension in the
    discussion forum. </p>
