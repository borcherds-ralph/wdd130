    <h2>How to check Rubric Grading</h2>
    <p>Starting in Week 6, the Rubric grading will be used a lot for feedback.</p>
    <p>The first thing to do is to go to your grades</p>
    <p>

            alt="Grade Link">
    </p>
    <p>Then find the assignment and click the Rubric icon</p>
    <p><img src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/rubric-link.png" alt="Rubric Link Icon"></p>
    <p>This will expand the rubric. This image shows all 3 things you need to look at.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The first thing to look at is to make sure that there is a grade on every line. If not let the instructor know. Every once in a while a option does not get recorded correctly.</li>
        <li>The next thing to look for is the graded items that do not have a full score. Look at the wording in the full score option and see what what graded</li>
        <li>The look at the comment for those items you do not have a full score. Those are the items you need to work on.</li>
    </ul>

        alt="Rubric"></p>
    <p>There may be other comments under the comments icon. that is the icon with the talk bubbles and there is usually a number in that icon. Read those comments as well.</p>
    <h3>Personal Site Grading</h3>
    <p>Starting in week 7, teh grading for the personal site shows a checkmark or an X if the assignment is not done. The issue is that even tough you have a checkmark, you may not have received full points. This is the way the system works.</p>
    <p>Grades are calculated on the points earned for these assignments, not if they were done or not. The only way to know if you missed any points is to look at the rubric.</p>
