    <title>How to Access BYU-Idaho e-mail system</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>It has come to my attention that a lot of you do not know that you do have an e-mail with @byui.edu. <strong>As
            someone that has attended classes through this university, you have this e-mail address for life.</strong>
    </p>
    <h3><span style="color: #050b77;"><strong>Pathway Worldwide Students<br /></strong></span></h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>From the Pathway dashboard, change the drop down in the center to say BYU-Idaho</p>
    <p><img src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/images/pw-switcher.png" alt="switcher">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Then click on your name in the top right corner.</p>
    <p>There is a link to "Go to Email". Arrow in this image is pointing to the link</p>
    <p><img src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/images/school-e-mail-pw.png"
            alt="school email"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You will be given the normal BYU-Idaho or BYU Pathway Worldwide login page. Click the Pathway Worldwide button
        and
        login as normal.</p>
    <p>This will take you to the Outlook online interface. If you have never accessed this e-mail account, you will have
        well 100 e-mails in there. This is especially true if you did not modify the notifications that Canvas sends
        on-demand by default.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It is very important that you check this e-mail or forward these e-mails to your personal e-mail account. Canvas
        sends notifications to this e-mail by default and almost every instructor sends e-mails using this e-mail system
        before the semester starts. This is why I sent the Welcome to the class in 3 different ways. The first was to
        your BYU-Idaho e-mail address. The second was to your Canvas e-mail account and the third was to post it as an
        announcement.</p>
    <p>Once you know yout BYU-Idaho e-mail address, you can login to your e-mail directly by going to: <a
            href="https://login.microsoftonline.com">https://login.microsoftonline.com</a>. You enter your BYU-Idaho
        e-mail address and then you will be prompted to login using the normal BYU-Idaho login page.</p>
