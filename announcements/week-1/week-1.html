  <title>Welcome to week 1</title>
</head>

<body>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> I know some of you will feel overwhelmed by
      all the new terminology that you will be learning. Do not get discouraged,
      it will come with some time and practice. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;">
      <strong>FYI:</strong> If you find something that does not make sense make
      sure to ask as it may be a left over from previous instructions. This is
      only the second semester with this content. <br>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>
    <strong>
      <span style="color: #050b77;">Your responsibilities</span>
    </strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <span style="color: #d70505;"> You are responsible to read all
      announcements. Announcements will clarify or change the instructions
    </span> . I have a lot of helps and suggestion in the announcements. I also
    give instructions in some weeks on how to make it easier to submit your
    homework as the instructions are not clear on how to do that. There are 55
    scheduled announcements over 14 weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="color: #d70505;"> You must check your feedback on each graded
      assignment to see how to improve your work </span> . Each weeks
    submissions, starting in week 2, builds on the previous week. This means
    that if you do not fix something, it will affect future weeks. The quiz on
    Steps for Success will teach you how to check your feedback.
  </p>
  <p> You MUST follow the instructions word for word. If you skim them you will
    miss important information and struggle with the course material. <span
      style="color: #d70505;"> Web development is a very detail oriented
      profession and I am a stickler for the details </span> . More details on
    how the instructions are written in a Week 4 announcement. </p>
  <p> Procrastination is an enemy in this class. Do not wait till the last day
    of the week to do the homework. You may not get it done on time. </p>
  <h2>
    <strong><span style="color: #050b77;">Grading Policy</span></strong>
  </h2>
  <p> I allow re-submission. Anything submitted after the due date/time you will
    receive a 5% penalty per day until you get a zero. This does include
    resubmissions. Submit early and you will have a chance to fix the issues and
    resubmit by the due date to get 100% on the assignment. </p>
  <p> As a professional web developer, late work is unacceptable to the clients
    and they expect you to be on-time, preferably early. That is what this
    policy is to teach you. </p>
  <h2>
    <strong>
      <span style="color: #050b77;"> Error messages in VSCode or with GitHub
        commands </span>
    </strong>
  </h2>
  <p> Take a screenshot of the error and post it into the Discussion Forum only.
    I will post how to fix that error. If the fix is not easy or I need more
    info, I will request a Zoom call so that I can see what is going on. I will
    record that session and post it as part of the answer. This way everyone can
    learn. Do not wait to install the software needed and setup GitHub. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>*********************************************************</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Before I get into what you will be doing
      this week I want to share with you some truths about learning. This is
      something that I learned years ago and it has helped. There are a couple
      of scriptures I want to point you too. The first thing you need to
      understand is that all truth belongs to the doctrine of the kingdom.
      President Brigham Young taught "If you can find a truth in heaven, earth
      or hell, it belongs to our doctrine. We believe it; it is ours; we claim
      it" (DBY, 2). This does not mean just spiritual knowledge but secular
      knowledge as well. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> The first scripture is found in
      <strong>D&amp;C 88:77-79</strong> . In these versus we find the
      commandment about gaining an education and how to teach one-another.&nbsp;
    </span>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> 77 And I give unto you a commandment that
        you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> 78 Teach ye diligently and my grace shall
        attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in
        principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that
        pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to
        understand; </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> 79 Of things both in heaven and in the
        earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are,
        things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things
        which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the
        judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and
        of kingdoms </span>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Verse 79 gives us a great list of things to
      learn in our lifetime. Think of the terminology used to day for each items
      in that list: "In the heavens" for example are things like astronomy,
      space flight, satellites, etc. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Notice it does not say to pick one or two
      things but to learn all. &nbsp;This is one of BYU-Idaho's principles,
      teaching you to become a lifelong learner. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> The second scripture is found in
      <strong>Alma 37:8</strong> . This is when Alma is explaining to his son
      Helaman about the writing on the plates and what his charge will be in
      keeping the record of his people. Verse 8 gives us a very helpful piece of
      information about how we can retain what we learn. I am bolding the part
      of the scripture I will be focusing on. </span>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> 8 And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in
        God that these things should be preserved; for behold, <strong>they have
          enlarged the memory of this people</strong> , yea, and convinced many
        of the error of their ways, and brought them to the knowledge of their
        God unto the salvation of their souls. </span>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> The word <strong>THEY</strong> is referring
      to the scriptures that Alma has been talking about. In other word by
      studying the scriptures, you will be blessed with a greater memory and be
      able to recall things to your mind. I promise you, if you keep studying
      the scriptures everyday along with your school work, you will be able to
      remember more and do better in school. It will take time to show your
      faithfulness to be able to get this blessing. </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>
    <span style="color: #081470;">What we will be doing this week</span>
  </h2>
  <p>There are two quizzes this week.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The first quiz is <strong>Steps for Success.</strong> This quiz takes
      you through the important aspects of the way the class is setup and some
      of the expectations.&nbsp; </li>
    <li> The second quiz is the <strong>Preparation quiz</strong> . You have to
      watch about 20 minutes of videos before taking the quiz as the quiz
      questions come from the 4 videos. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> You will then setup your code editor. For this class we will be install
    Microsoft Visual Code editor.&nbsp; This is commonly refereed to as
    VSCode/VS-Code/VS Code. I do 90% of my professional development using this
    code editor. </p>
  <p> Once you have the code editor installed you will jump right into creating
    your first HTML page. You will be creating an About Me page. This page tells
    the other class members who you are. You will then post the output of this
    page as an image into W01 Icebreaker: Getting to Know You discussion board.
    You will then have to respond to other students and try to make connections
    with them. </p>
  <p> My About Me page is posted into the discussion board. as the first post.
  </p>
  <p> Yours will not be as fancy and formatted. This is an example of what to
    put into your page. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>
    <strong>
      <span style="color: #081470;">Additional Helps for the class</span>
    </strong>
  </h2>
  <p> I highly recommend you install a browser extension called FireShot. This
    extension allows you to capture an entire web page as an image in PNG
    format. Firefox has its own screen grab utility you can utilize. </p>
  <p> The Chrome extension (works in Microsoft Edge) can be found by going here:
    &nbsp; <a
      href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/take-webpage-screenshots/mcbpblocgmgfnpjjppndjkmgjaogfceg?hl=en"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/take-webpage-screenshots/mcbpblocgmgfnpjjppndjkmgjaogfceg?hl=en
    </a>
  </p>
  <p> The Firefox extension can be found here <a
      href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireshot/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireshot/ </a>
  </p>
  <p> If you are going to be taking the web development and design classes from
    BYU-Idaho, quite a few of the classes will ask you to make screen shots of
    the web pages you are creating. The FireShot extension will make it so much
    easier to create them. Fireshot is free to use the basic features. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> You may also use the <strong>built in snip-it tools in Windows and
      MacOS</strong> . &nbsp;Read these articles on how to use them:&nbsp; </p>
  <p> Windows: <a
      href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots-00246869-1843-655f-f220-97299b865f6b"

  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Another program I highly recommend is called <strong>Flameshot</strong> :
    <a href="https://flameshot.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://flameshot.org/ </a> - This runs on Windows, Mac, Linux.&nbsp; You
    can add things like arrows to your screenshots before you save them. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <strong> Some announcements will be open for comments, mainly the spiritual
      thought/question for the week </strong> .&nbsp; Please post all other
    questions, comments, etc about the course in the Discussion Forum for the
    week. I prefer that all question about the course or your homework be posted
    in the discussion forum so everyone can learn from the questions. I answer
    these every evening.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Personal issues you must e-mail me using Canvas only</strong> . Do
    not use my BYU-Idaho e-mail address for course questions.
