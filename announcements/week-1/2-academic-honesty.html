  <title>Academic Honesty at BYU-Idaho</title>
</head>

<body>
  <p> Some of you may have experience with HTML/CSS and other web technologies
    in the past. One of the things you have to be pay attention to is the
    Academic Honesty at BYU-Idaho. Because we have students from a lot of
    countries, I want to make sure you all understand what BYU-Idaho expects.
    Each culture has a slightly different interpretation of these Honesty
    Policies and in the work place it is different as well, but we are in a
    school setting. </p>
  <p> This is taken directly from training the instructors receive about the
    various ways students can violate the Honor Code in your courses. In this
    class and many of the development classes the most common forms are
    Fabrication, Cheating, and Other Misconduct from the definitions below. </p>
  <p> The way you cheat is by using code you did not write or using libraries,
    such as jQuery, without authorization from the instructor to complete the
    work. Some libraries are required to complete work in other classes. The
    real world this is not an issue to use public libraries as that is what they
    are for. For school work, they want to make sure you know how everything
    works by having you create it from scratch. This does help you once you get
    into the real world to troubleshoot bugs. </p>
  <p> All instructors look for these things in the work that is submitted.
    Personally, I have used a lot of libraries and tools for work and I have
    spent thousands of dollars to buy licenses as well. I have seen a lot of
    libraries and I know what they look like. Other instructors may not pickup
    on them as fast but most do. </p>
  <p>Dishonesty may get you good grades but at what cost?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Academic Dishonesty Definitions</h2>
  <p><strong>Inadvertent Plagiarism</strong></p>
  <p> Inadvertent plagiarism involves the inappropriate, but non-deliberate, use
    of another's words, ideas, or data without proper attribution. Although not
    a violation of the Honor Code, it is a form of academic misconduct for which
    an instructor can impose appropriate academic sanctions. </p>

  <p><strong>Plagiarism</strong></p>
  <p> Intentional plagiarism is the deliberate act of representing the words,
    ideas, or data of another as one's own without providing proper attribution
    on the original author through quotation, reference, or footnote. </p>
  <p> Plagiarism is probably the most well-known element of academic dishonesty.
  </p> 
  <p>this includes the use of artificial intelligence technologies such as ChatGPT and passing it off as your own</p>

  <p><strong>Fabrication or Falsification</strong></p>
  <p> Fabrication or falsification occurs when a student invents or distorts the
    origin or content of information used as authority. Examples include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Citing a source that does not exist</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Citing information from a source that is not included in the source
        for which credit is given </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Citing a source for a secondary proposition that it does not support
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Cheating</strong></p>
  <p> A student cheats when he or she attempts to give the appearance of a level
    of knowledge or skill that has not been obtained. Examples include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p> Using unauthorized materials during an examination or while completing
        an assignment, this includes artificial intelligence technologies such as ChatGPT</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Collaborating on an examination or assignment without authorization
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Taking an examination or completing an assignment for another, or
        permitting another to take an examination or to complete an assignment
        that is not his or her own </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Other Misconduct</strong></p>
  <p>Other academic misconduct includes other academically dishonest,
    deceitful, or inappropriate acts which are intentionally committed. Examples
    include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Obtaining or providing to another a test or answers</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Submitting the same work for more than one class without disclosure and approval. There are many classes you can take where you may work on your resume/CV. If you have worked on it in another course your instructor needs to know that is where you are starting from and not creating it from scratch. Your instructor will give you guidance as to what to do. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Getting equal credit on group assignments when equal work was not done </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Using content from a previous/other class in your current class.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Using artificial intelligence technologies to help or do your work as a student. The list of AI tools is too long to list all of them. Just know that you are not allowed to use them for anything that you submit for grading.<p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>If any of you have questions about this please let me know.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Libraries and Frameworks allowed in this class: NONE</strong> . You will be given persmission to use code from a specific website in week 12. You will be able to use that and only that in this course. Do not use CSS framework rules. Students have tried to use individual rules from Bootstrap, Foundations, and Material CSS in my class. Do not do it, I have been using these myself in  my professions so I recognize them very quickly.
  </p>
  <p> I will allow you to use icosng from Hero Icons ( <a href="https://heroicons.com/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://heroicons.com </a> ) and Box Icons (https://boxicons.com) for icons to
    be used in your final project. You must copy the SVG code of the icons into your
    code. You will not be permitted to use them as font icons. It does take time to learn how to this correctly. </p>
  <p>The only JavaScript that will be allowed in this course will come from Week 10 and Week 12. Week 10 you are given some code to simulated submitting a form amd week 12 you get to choose a web component from W3Schools website to use in your final project. If you JavaScript does not come from one of those 2 places, you are not allowed to use it.<p>
