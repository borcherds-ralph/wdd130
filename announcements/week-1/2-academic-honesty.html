    <title>Academic Honesty at BYU-Idaho</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Some of you may have experience with HTML/CSS and other web technologies in the past. One of the things you have
        to be pay attention to is the Academic Honesty at BYU-Idaho. Because we have students from a lot of countries, I
        want to make sure you all understand what BYU-Idaho expects. Each culture has a slightly different
        interpretation of these Honesty Policies and in the work place it is different as well, but we are in a school
        setting.</p>
    <p>This is taken directly from training the instructors receive about the various ways students can violate the
        Honor Code in your courses. In this class and many of the development classes the most common forms are
        Fabrication, Cheating, and Other Misconduct from the definitions below.</p>
    <p>The way you cheat is by using code you did not write or using libraries, such as jQuery, without authorization
        from the instructor to complete the work. Some libraries are required to complete work in other classes. The
        real world this is not an issue to use public libraries as that is what they are for. For school work, they want
        to make sure you know how everything works by having you create it from scratch. This does help you once you get
        into the real world to troubleshoot bugs.</p>
    <p>All instructors look for these things in the work that is submitted. Personally, I have used a lot of libraries
        and tools for work and I have spent thousands of dollars to buy licenses as well. I have seen a lot of libraries
        and I know what they look like. Other instructors may not pickup on them as fast but most do.</p>
    <p>Dishonesty may get you good grades but at what cost?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Academic Dishonesty Definitions</h2>
    <p><strong>Inadvertent Plagiarism</strong></p>
    <p>Inadvertent plagiarism involves the inappropriate, but non-deliberate, use of another's words, ideas, or data
        without proper attribution. Although not a violation of the Honor Code, it is a form of academic misconduct for
        which an instructor can impose appropriate academic sanctions.</p>
    <p><strong>Plagiarism</strong></p>
    <p>Intentional plagiarism is the deliberate act of representing the words, ideas, or data of another as one's own
        without providing proper attribution on the original author through quotation, reference, or footnote.</p>
    <p>Plagiarism is probably the most well-known element of academic dishonesty.</p>
    <p><strong>Fabrication or Falsification</strong></p>
    <p>Fabrication or falsification occurs when a student invents or distorts the origin or content of information used
        as authority. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Citing a source that does not exist</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Citing information from a source that is not included in the source for which credit is given</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Citing a source for a secondary proposition that it does not support</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Cheating</strong></p>
    <p>A student cheats when he or she attempts to give the appearance of a level of knowledge or skill that has not
        been obtained. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Using unauthorized materials during an examination or while completing an assignment</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Collaborating on an examination or assignment without authorization</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Taking an examination or completing an assignment for another, or permitting another to take an
                examination or to complete an assignment that is not his or her own</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Other Misconduct</strong></p>
    <p>Other academic misconduct includes other academically dishonest, deceitful, or inappropriate acts which are
        intentionally committed. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Obtaining or providing to another a test or answers</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Submitting the same work for more than one class without disclosure and approval</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Getting equal credit on group assignments when equal work was not done</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Using content from a previous/other class in your current class.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br><br></p>
    <p><br><br></p>
    <p>If any of you have questions about this please let me know.</p>
    <p><strong>Libraries and Frameworks allowed in this class: NONE</strong>. You will be given one piece of JavaScript
        code to use and that is the only JavaScript allowed. Do not use CSS framework rules. Students have tried to use
        individual rules from Bootstrap, Foundations, and Material CSS in my class. Do not do it.</p>
    <p>I will allow you to use Hero Icons (<a href="https://heroicons.com/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">https://heroicons.com</a>) for icons to be used in your form in the final project. You copy
        the SVG code into your code for use. It does take time to learn how to do that.</p>
    <p>In your final project, if you want to do a slider for example, you have to use pure CSS to do that and no
        JavaScript.
