                    <p>This has to do with how Git is configured with GPG signing process. This is an issue on Windows
                        computers, as the GPG implementation is weird.</p>
                    <p>There are a few potential ways to fix this issue. I would recommend turning off the signing with
                        GPG.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here are the steps to disable this option</p>
                    <p>Go to VSCode preferences - Settings</p>

                    <p>Make sure this option is not checked. This is the option that tells VSCode to use PGP while
                        pushing to GitHub: Enables commit signing with GPG or X.509</p>

                    <p>This error occurs when you have GitHub setup on one account and you try to use another account
                        and GitHub auto logs you into the old account with VSCode.</p>
                    <p>You don&apos;t have permission to push to &lt;GitHub Account&gt; on GitHub. Would you like to
                        create a fork and push it instead?</p>

                    <p>This error is because VSCode was previously configured for another user account on GitHub. There
                        are two solutions.</p>

                    <p>Go to GitHub and log into the old account and click on the user profile picture in the top right
                        of the web page. Select Settings
                    </p>

                    <p>On the left navigation menu, select Password and Authentication</p>

                    <p>Then click on the Authorized Oauth Apps tab</p>
                    <img src="images/github-oath-apps.png" alt="GitHub AOuth Tab">
                    <p>Find teh GitHub for VSCode line</p>
                    <p>Click on the 3 dots to the left of GitHub for VSCode</p>
                    <img src="images/github-oauth-link.png" alt="GitHub Oauth entry">
                    <p>Click the Revoke option</p>

                    <p>This will force VSCode to re-authenticate with GitHub.</p>


                    <p>
                        If this is not a possibility and you must have two GitHub accounts with VSCode You have to go
                        through an elaborate setup with a few extensions and you use the Profile icon in the bar in
                        VSCode to switch to the various profiles. This is problematic at times.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This from StackOverflow has all the steps needed to setup multiple accounts. There are 3
                        possibilities.

                    <p>
                        There are other authentication methods, but they are much more complex to setup and require
                        installation
                        of additional
                        software.

                    <summary>GitHub Pages does not initialize</summary>
                    <p>There is an issue where the GitHub pages do not initialize the first time. This means you must
                        re-initialize a push to
                        GitHub and then recreate the pages setup.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Go to the pages setup page and change the branch to NONE</p>

                            <p>Go to VSCode and push to GitHub</p>

                            <p>Yu can do an empty push by typing the following commands in the command prompt</p>

                            <pre class="code-style">
                            git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger rebuild"<br>

                        </pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Go back to GitHub Pages and recreate the pages setup.</p>

                            <p>Click on the Actions menu option</p>

                                Watch the top entry until the icon to the left turns blue with a check mark. That means
                                it is complete. The red circle with an X means that it failed.

                            <p>You will notice that the process will take longer than 1 minute. This is due to some

                                publishing the push/sync from VSCode takes as long as 90 seconds (1 min 30 sec).</p>

                                there are underscores in

                    <p> There are a few reasons as to why this will occur. There are a couple of things to try.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Open a terminal/command window and try to push to GitHub using the command line</p>

                            <pre>git push</pre>

                            <p>You may get an error that says something like this (It will look different on the various
                                OS&apos;s):</p>

                            <pre>
                                There is no tracking information for the current branch.<br>
                                Please specify which branch you want to merge with.<br>

                                If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:<br><br>
                            
                                git push --set-upstream origin master

                            <p>If you get that error at the command line type in the command</p>

                            <pre>git push &minus;set-upstream origin master</pre>


                            <p>Then do a git push command</p>

                            <p>You may be prompted to authenticate with GitHub again.</p>

                            <p>
                                Once the push/sync is complete, you will need to restart VSCode and the GitHub controls
                                within VSCode should work again.

                            The other reasons why this process will hang are too numerous and hard to give instructions
                            on how to overcome in this document. This will require more research with debug logs to see
                            if there is a reason for the hang.

                    <p>
                        The instructions to fix this are specific to the version of Windows that is being run. Here are
                        the basic steps:

                    <h3>Use controlled folder access</h3>
                    <p>
                        Controlled folder access in Windows Security reviews the apps that can make changes to files in
                        protected folders and
                        block unauthorized or unsafe apps from accessing or changing files in those folders.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There is an option to allow just one program to run in this Controlled Folder Access and you can
                        select git.exe from the
                        recently blocked programs.

                    <p>
                        The reason for this error is that the code on GitHub was edited and the user did not issue a git
                        pull command before
                        making any changes to their local machine before they started to edit on the local machine.

                    <p> To fix this error there are a few options.</p>

                            The first and usually the easiest for those new to Git/GitHub is to recreate the repository.
                            You have to unpublish
                            the site, delete the repository, delete the .git folder on the local and then push back to a
                            Public Repository on
                            GitHub.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The preferred way is to stash the changes, pull from the server, merge your stashed
                                changes into the update from the
                                server and then push back to the server.
                            </p>
                            <p>Run these commands:</p>
                            <pre>
                                git stash<br>
                                git pull<br>
                                git stash pop &lt;&minus; This will apply your saved changes<br>
                                git commit -m “message”<br>
                                git push<br>
                                git stash clear &lt;&minus; This will remove the stashed files from memory. Stashed files stay until removed.<br>
                            </pre>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            You can try and issue a &apos;git push -f&apos; command at the command line and see it will
                            go through. This is still not a guarantee that it will push.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                You can create a new branch and push to the new brach. You can then go to the fork and
                                use the built in process on
                                GitHub to validate the change in the fork and merge back to the master/main branch.
                                (This is the way most companies do
                                development)
