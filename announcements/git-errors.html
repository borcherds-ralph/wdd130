            <summary>Git: gpg: skipped &lt;email&gt;: No Secret Key</summary>
            <img src="images/git-gpg-no-key.png" alt="Git No GPG Error">
            <p> This has to do with how Git is configured with GPG signing
              process. This is an issue on Windows computers, as the GPG
              implementation is weird. </p>
            <p> There are a few potential ways to fix this issue. I would
              recommend turning off the signing with GPG. </p>
            <p>Here are the steps to disable this option</p>
            <p>Go to VSCode preferences - Settings</p>
            <img src="images/gpg-1.png" alt="GPG error steps 1">
            <p> Type this into the search bar at the top to find the setting:
              gpg commit </p>
            <img src="images/gpg-2.png" alt="GPG error step 2">
            <p> Make sure this option is not checked. This is the option that
              tells VSCode to use PGP while pushing to GitHub: Enables commit
              signing with GPG or X.509 </p>
            <img src="images/gpg-3.png" alt="GPG error step 3">

              Account&gt; on GitHub</summary>
            <p>This error occurs when you have GitHub setup on one account and
              you try to use another account and GitHub auto logs you into the
              old account with VSCode. </p>
            <img src="images/git-error-push-github.png"
              alt="Git Error no authorization">
            <p>This error is because Git was previously configured for another
              user account on the computer using the global settings. There are
              a a few solutions.</p>
            <details>
              <summary>Potentially Destructive and Permanent method</summary>
              <p>Only use this method if the computer was used by someone else
                and now a new person is using the computer and both people are
                available to do this. This is also a method to reset or
                reconfigure the user on the same computer due to corruption.</p>
              <p>Go to GitHub and log into the old account and click on the user
                profile picture in the top right of the web page. <span

              <p>This will force VSCode to re-authenticate with GitHub.</p>
              <p> If this is not a possibility and you must have two GitHub
                accounts with VSCode You have to go through an elaborate setup
                with an extensions and that is listed below. </p>
              <p> There are other authentication methods, but they are much more
                complex to setup and require installation of additional software
                to create SSH keys for unique encryption process and
                authentication. </p>

              <summary>Preferred Method</summary>
              <p> Make sure each student is using a different system Account to
                log into the computer. This is not always possible, but the
                preferred method and easiest. Some families do not allow this,
                one reason is so people do not have the temptation of going to
                inappropriate sites because everyone else in the family will see
                where they went. </p>
              <p> This web page explains the various locations that the config
                files may be found in Windows: <a
                  href="https://www.onwebsecurity.com/configuration/git-on-windows-location-of-global-configuration-file.html"
                  target="_blank">On Web Security</a>. The first command on this
                page</p>
              <pre class="code-style">git config --list –show-origin</pre>
              <p>will show you where the config files are located. If you run
                this in a folder that is part of a repository you will see the
                global and repository locations. If run outside of a repository,
                it will show only the global config.</p>
              <p> <span class="bold-text">Windows</span>: The reason for the
                different Profiles/Accounts on the computer is that git should
                store the config for that profile in a hidden file in the <span
                  class="bold-text">%USERPROFILE%\.gitconfig</span> file. The
                <span class="bold-text">%userprofile%</span> is usually in the
                <span class="bold-text">c:\users\username</span> folder
                depending on who is logged in. This does not always work as the
                location of the .config file may be found in a shared area of
                the system. That is why you should run the command above to see
                where the global config is located.</p>
              <p> <span class="bold-text">Mac / Linux</span>system stores the
                file in the HOME folder for the user by default in a hidden file
                called <span class="bolded-text">.gitconfig</span> and is much
                more reliable than Windows for the location. </p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Manual method</summary>
              <p>Do not use the <span class="bold-text">git config
                  --global</span> command. The student must set the username and
                email for each repository. To do this they will have to edit the
                <span class="bold-text">.git/config</span> file for each
                repository and add the correct entries or run the git config
                commands in the repository directory after the git init command
                and do not use the global option.</p>
              <pre
                class="colde-style">git config --global user.email "email"<br>git config --global user.name "github username"</pre>
              <p>That will set the username and email address per repository in
                each <span class="bold-text">.git/config</span> file. </p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Use VSCode Extension</summary>
              <p>Install a VSCode extension that will do this for you: “Git
                Config User Profiles” Here is a link to the description of the
                extension <a
                  href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=onlyutkarsh.git-config-user-profiles"

              </p>
              <p>This extension does the configuring of the username and email
                address in each repository for you or will change the global
                config setting for each person that you switch too.</p>

            <p> There is an issue where the GitHub pages do not initialize the
              first time. This means you must re-initialize a push to GitHub and
              then recreate the pages setup. </p>

              <li>
                <p>Go to VSCode and push to GitHub</p>
                <p>You can do an empty push by typing the following commands in
                  the command prompt </p>
                <pre class="code-style">

              <li>
                <p>Go back to GitHub Pages and recreate the pages setup.</p>
                <p>Once you have clicked save on the pages setup, click on the <span class="menu-select">Actions</span> tab</p>

                <p> You will notice that the process will take longer than 1

                  server due to new features that are being added. Even
                  publishing the push/sync from VSCode takes as long as 5 min on very busy days. </p>
                <p> If the user gets a failed again, check the spelling of the
                  folders and file names. This process seems to fail if the user
                  has spaces in the folder and filenames and sometimes if there

              anything </summary>
            <p> There are a few reasons as to why this will occur. There are a
              couple of things to try. </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p> Open a terminal/command window and try to push to GitHub
                  using the command line </p>
                <pre>git push</pre>
                <p> You may get an error that says something like this (It will
                  look different on the various OS&apos;s): </p>
                <pre>
                                There is no tracking information for the current branch.<br>
                                Please specify which branch you want to merge with.<br>
                                See git-pull(1) for details<br><br>

                                git push &lt;remote&gt;  &lt;branch&gt;<br><br>


                                If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:<br><br>

                                git push --set-upstream origin master
                            </pre>
                <p> If you get that error at the command line type in the
                  command </p>
                <pre>git push &minus;set-upstream origin master</pre>
                <p>Then do a git push command</p>
                <p>You may be prompted to authenticate with GitHub again.</p>
                <p> Once the push/sync is complete, you will need to restart
                  VSCode and the GitHub controls within VSCode should work
                  again. </p>
              </li>
              <li> The other reasons why this process will hang are too numerous
                and hard to give instructions on how to overcome in this
                document. This will require more research with debug logs to see
                if there is a reason for the hang. </li>

            <p> The reason for this error is that the code on GitHub was edited
              and the user did not issue a git pull command before making any
              changes to their local machine before they started to edit on the
              local machine. </p>
            <p>To fix this error there are a few options.</p>
            <ol>
              <li> The first and usually the easiest for those new to Git/GitHub
                is to recreate the repository. You have to unpublish the site,
                delete the repository, delete the .git folder on the local and
                then push back to a Public Repository on GitHub. </li>
              <li>
                <p> The preferred way is to stash the changes, pull from the
                  server, merge your stashed changes into the update from the
                  server and then push back to the server. </p>
                <p>Run these commands:</p>
                <pre>
                                git stash<br>
                                git pull<br>
                                git stash pop &lt;&minus; This will apply your saved changes<br>
                                git commit -m “message”<br>
                                git push<br>
                                git stash clear &lt;&minus; This will remove the stashed files from memory. Stashed files stay until removed.<br>
                            </pre>
              </li>
              <li> You can try and issue a &apos;git push -f&apos; command at
                the command line and see it will go through. This is still not a
                guarantee that it will push. </li>
              <li>
                <p> You can create a new branch and push to the new brach. You
                  can then go to the fork and use the built in process on GitHub
                  to validate the change in the fork and merge back to the
                  master/main branch. (This is the way most companies do
                  development) </p>

            <p>If the user installs the Prettier extension, which is not needed,
              the first time they go to format the code, they will be prompted
              to select a formatter for that type of file type (HTML or CSS).
              VSCode as a code formatter built into the editor that works well
              with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. </p>
            <img src="images/formatters-configure.png" alt="Choose Formatter">
            <p>One of the issues with the Prettier formatter is that is closes
              null tags. What this means is that tags such as the img tag will
              be closed with /> at the end. This is XHTML syntax and not part of
              HTML5 standards.</p>
            <p>Prettier is what is knows as an Opinionated Formatter. It is
              opinionated in that the creators of it are stating what they
              believe is the best way to format something even if it goes
              against the standards or not explicitly stated that this is the
              way it must be done. They do not give you the option to turn that

            <p> The default maximum length for a git commit message is 50
              characters </p>
            <p> There is a way to add more details to the commit so that you can
              see what you did in a lot more detail without having to look at
              the code changes directly. </p>
            <p> In VSCode, do not type a message before you hit the
              commit/commit &amp; sync button </p>
            <p> By doing this you will get prompted with a screen in the code
              editor for the commit message like this </p>

            <summary>Adding a description to your repository</summary>
            <p> One of the things you will see in a lot of repositories is a
              description of what the repository is all about, how to install
              and use the code, etc. </p>
            <p> This is all done using Markdown text. This will show you the
              details of how to use that so you can describe wheat you
              repository is all about. </p>
            <p> First you need to create a file in the top level folder called
              README.md. It must be capitalized for GuitHub to recognize it as
              the description file for the repository </p>
