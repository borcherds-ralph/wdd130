    <h1>VSCode - Git - GitHub basic explanations</h1>
    <p> The question has come up as to what to type into the git commit message
      area. </p>
    <p> Before I get into the best practice, I want to explain a few things.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p> The process to commit and sync with GitHub is a multiple step
          procedure. </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Commit to staged status&nbsp;&nbsp; (git commit -m "message")
          </li>
          <li> Send staged to Github via a push command or a sync command&nbsp;
            (git push origin &lt;branch name on GitHub&gt;&nbsp; Most of you
            will have either the branch name as MASTER or MAIN on GitHub. </li>
          <li> Pull any changes from GitHub to local computer. (git pull
            &lt;remote branch name&gt;) </li>
        </ul>
        <p> You can do all these commands at the same time by doing a Commit
          &amp; Sync (git sync origin &lt;remote branch&gt;). In VSCode this is
          done by click the blue button if it sayd Commit &amp; Sync or click
          the down arrow on the right side of the button and select commit &amp;
          sync </p>
        <p>

            alt="commit &amp; sync">
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> There is a box to type a message in before you hit the commit/commit
          &amp; sync button. This screenshot shows the commit &amp; sync as one
          button. Most of you will only have COMMIT button. </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/vscode-commit-message-box.png"
            alt="commit message box">
        </p>
        <p> If you hit the commit button without a message, you will get an
          editor screen that looks something like this image. You have to type a
          message into line 1. You must save and close this editor screen for
          the commit process to continue. </p>

        <p>What to type in the MESSAGE box.</p>
        <p> This is limited to 72 characters in length. The best commit messages
          follow the guidelines from this article: <a
            href="https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">

          </a>
        </p>
        <p>Basically it is this type of message</p>
        <pre><code>Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
            bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
            generated by commands like git merge and git revert.</code></pre>
        <p>From the page mentioned. There are 2 types of messages.</p>
        <div class="preformatted">
          <h2>Rules for a great git commit message style</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Separate subject from body with a blank line</li>
            <li>Do not end the subject line with a period</li>
            <li>Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph</li>
            <li>Use the imperative mood in the subject line</li>
            <li>Wrap lines at 72 characters</li>
            <li> Use the body to explain what and why you have done something.
              In most cases, you can leave out details about how a change has
              been made. </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Information in commit messages</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Describe why a change is being made.</li>
            <li>How does it address the issue?</li>
            <li>What effects does the patch have?</li>
            <li> Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original
              problem was. </li>
            <li>Do not assume the code is self-evident/self-documenting.</li>
            <li> Read the commit message to see if it hints at improved code
              structure. </li>
            <li>The first commit line is the most important.</li>
            <li>Describe any limitations of the current code.</li>
            <li>Do not include patch set-specific comments.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p> Details for each point and good commit message examples can be found
          on <a
            href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages#Information_in_commit_messages">

          </a>
        </p>
        <p> If you want to add more data than the main message line, which is
          line 1 of the text, you hit the commit button and then in the editor
          screen add you message and then go below what is there and enter
          additional info. Remember to keep is as short as possible. Every one
          on the internet can read that info if they so wish.This screenshot
          gives you and example of that. The arrow pointing to the vertical line
          is the max width or characters allowed. The arrow at the bottom shows
          and additional message added. </p>

    <p> There is a lot more info that can be given on this topic but I will
      leave that up to you to research and read if you so wish. This is just the
      info you need to get started. </p>
    <p> VSCode documentation on Source Control and how it works within VSCode:

    </p>
    <p> To read commit messages and to look at what changes have been made. Open
      a repo, click on the commits. The number next to the word will be
      different for each repo </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p> You will see a screen like this one. Click on the little box with the 3
      dots and you will see the additional message </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/vscode-message-details-2.png"
        alt="details 2">
    </p>
    <p> In the image above you will notice an orange dot. That means the
      publication to the GitHub Pages is running. The check mark means that
      commit was successful. </p>
    <p> In this next image it shows the additional message and it has a red
      circle with an X in it meaning the publication to GitHub Pages failed.
    </p>
