    <title>Wireframe Software</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>I have come across a free Wireframe Software program called Drawio-Desktop that you install on your
        computer. There is an online version of this software at <a href="https://mydraft.cc/">https://mydraft.cc/</a>
        but you cannot export the wireframes to images. You can only print them to a printer or PDF file.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To download the software to install: <a href="https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases</a></p>
    <p>Select the correct OS you are running, save the file and then run it to install it. You may need to click "Show
        All Assets" link to see your operating system install file. There are files for Windows (32 & 64 bit), MacOS,
        Linux DEB, RPM and Appimage files. The file with this as part of the name "windows-no-installer.exe" does not
        install the software on Windows, it is what is called a run-time version and just runs as a stand-alone program
        without needing to be installed. You can run this from a USB drive if you wish to use it on multiple computers
        without installing it.</p>
    <p>Windows files have the .exe or .msi at the end of the filename, MacOS .dmg or .zip at the end, and Linux has the
        .deb or .rpm extensions.</p>
    <p>This is opensource and the link has installation programs for all operating systems. You can export the
        wireframes as images for the assignments.</p>
    <p>This is quite easy to use software, it is free and you can use it anywhere. This also allows you to export each
        page to an image format very easily.</p>
    <p>Updates are released monthly, sometimes more.</p>
