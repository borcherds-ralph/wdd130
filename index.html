            <p>I am your instructor for this course. My last name is pronounced like orchards with a
                B in front of it.</p>
            <p>I am a graduate of Brigham Young University-Idaho with a Bachelors in Web Design and
                Development. After graduation I decided to become an instructor for the school and
                give back to the school. I found that I enjoyed teaching while I was a student.</p>

            <p>I live in the desert of Southern California about 20 miles outside of Palm
                Springs, CA. I am an IT Consultant and professional Web Developer and do a lot
                of consulting for local companies. I am always working on a new web project
                using PHP, JavaScript, CSS/SCSS, MySQL technologies. You will learn about these
                as you learn more about web development.</p>
            <p>My wife and daughter also received their Bachelors from BYU-Idaho. My wife earned
                her Bachelors of Science in Nursing and my daughter earned her Business
                Administration Bachelors. We all graduated the same semester, April 2020 right
                after the lock-downs started. </p>
            <p>I am the Elders Quorum President in my ward and my wife if the Relief Society
                President. As such we are very busy with our callings and coordinating the Lords
                work in the Ward. We have eight grandchildren and the ninth grandchild will be
                born shortly after this block ends. </p>
            <p>We have 9 grandchildren with the newest born in August 2024. We do spend most Saturday mornings riding
                horses, so no meetings with students during family time.</p>

            <p>California is on the west coast of the USA and borders Mexico on the South, Arizona
                and Nevada on the East and Oregon on the North with the Pacific ocean on the west.

            <p>The image was taken from my property looking towards Los Angeles, California. I live about 20 miles
                outside of downtown Palm Springs. The valley I live is called Coachella Vallaey and is home to the music
                festivals of Coachella Fest
                and Stagecoach. Both festivals are usually held in April. Coachella Fest is held over two weekends and
                Stagecoach is only one weekend. Stagecoach is the country & western music festival.</p>
