                Here is a run down of the activities and skills the youth did
            </p>
            <h4>Hatchet throwing</h4>
            <p>The youth were shown the proper way to throw a hatchet into wood. Some did great and other need a lot
                more practice. This is not an easy skill to learn and do repeatedly.</p>
            <h4>Musket shooting</h4>
            <p>What is it like to shoot a musket gun? Well they had the opportunity to learn and shoot a target. Most
                were surprised at how loud the pistols are and how the gun recoils.</p>
            <h4>roping</h4>
            <p>They got the opportunity to practice roping a steer head. This is not as easy as it looks and it takes a
                lot of practice and determination to do correctly.</p>
            <h4>cutting wood with 2 man saw</h4>
            <p>Have you ever tried to cut a tree using a 2 man saw? These saws are long and heavy and do not cut as easy
                as you would expect. They take practice to get the timing down so that each person can pull the saw at the right time and get the logs cut.</p>
            <h4>Dance etiquette</h4>
            <p>This was an interesting activity in that the youth learned a few things about dance etiquette from the
                pioneer days. One such rule was that if a girl was asked to dance, they could not say no. If they did, they were done
                dancing for the night.</p>
            <h4>Fire starting with flit</h4>
            <p>Very few of the youth were able to actually start a fire using flint. Most of the youth were too scared
                to strike the flint and steel together hard enough to produce a spark. For a lot of them this was a scarry prospect.
            </p>
            <h4>bow and arrow shooting</h4>
            <p>How hard is it to shoot an arrow straight using a bow from the 1800's? Quite hard for most of the youth.
                This was another fun activity to show them that life was not so easy and it took a lot of work to survive.</p>
