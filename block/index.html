            <p>I am your instructor for this course. My last name is pronounced like orchards with a
                B in front of it.</p>
            <p>I am a graduate of Brigham Young University-Idaho with a Bachelors in Web Design and
                Development. After graduation I decided to become an instructor for the school and
                give back to the school. I found that I enjoyed teaching while I was a student.</p>
            <div class="text-2">
                <p>I live in the desert of Southern California about 20 miles outside of Palm
                    Springs, CA. I am an IT Consultant and professional Web Developer and do a lot
                    of consulting for local companies. I am always working on a new web project
                    using PHP, JavaScript, CSS/SCSS, MySQL technologies. You will learn about these
                    as you learn more about web development.</p>
                <p>My wife and daughter also received their Bachelors from BYU-Idaho. My wife earned
                    her Bachelors of Science in Nursing and my daughter earned her Business
                    Administration Bachelors. We all graduated the same semester, April 2020 right
                    after the lock-downs started. </p>
                <p>I am the Elders Quorum President in my ward and my wife if the Relief Society
                    President. As such we are very busy with our callings and coordinating the Lords
                    work in the Ward. We have eight grandchildren and we will get at least one more
                    in 2024. </p>
